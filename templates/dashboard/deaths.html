        <h1 class="display-4 px-0 text-center"> What is the daily number of confirmed deaths?</h1>
        <p class="fs-4 text-center"> The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths, this is due to limited testing and problems in the attribution of the cause of death. The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies by country.
          How COVID-19 deaths are recorded may differ between countries (e.g., some countries may only count hospital deaths, whilst others also include deaths in homes).
          The death figures on a given date do not necessarily show the number of new deaths on that day, but the deaths reported on that day. Since reporting can vary significantly from day to day, irrespectively of any actual variation of deaths</p>

        <h1 class="display-4 px-0 text-center"> Daily confirmed deaths per million people</h1>
        <p class="fs-4 text-center"> Differences in the population size between countries are often large, and the COVID-19 death count in more populous countries tends to be higher. Because of this it can be insightful to know how the number of confirmed deaths in a country compares to the number of people who live there, especially when comparing across countries.
          For instance, if 1,000 people died in Iceland, out of a population of about 340,000, that would have a far bigger impact than the same number dying in the United States, with its population of 331 million.1 This difference in impact is clear when comparing deaths per million people of each countryâ€™s population, in this example it would be roughly 3 deaths/million people in the US compared to a staggering 2,941 deaths/million people in Iceland.</p>
